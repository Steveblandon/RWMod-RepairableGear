REMARKS:
When building this project, it will need to reference certain DLLs that come with the Rimworld installation. 
The build file expects this to be located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\", this is what the project considers the game's root directory.

When you build, mod files are automatically copied to the game's root directory /mods subdirectory so it should appear in the game's mod list without you having to manually
move files.
