"Repairable Gear" Mod source code for the video game Rimworld.

REMARKS:
When building this project, it will need to reference certain DLLs that come with the Rimworld installation. 
The build file expects this to be located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\", this is what the project considers the game's root directory.

To change this, unload the 'RepairableGear' project (not solution) and edit the project file. Look for this line

<GameDir>CHANGE THIS TO YOUR RIMWORLD INSTALL</GameDir>



When you build, mod files are automatically copied to the game's root directory /mods subdirectory so it should appear in the game's mod list without you having to manually
move files.
